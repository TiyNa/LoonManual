# Say a few more words

- Although the `[Script]` module is supported, it is not recommended to write the script configuration code of the **check-in script** into the plug-in file, because adding scripts in this way does not allow users to modify the script execution time

- It is recommended to write script configuration code similar to `Jingdong, Taobao historical price script` into the plug-in file, because such scripts will not have pop-up reminders, and there is no need to modify the execution time
