![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) 将订阅脚本内需要的脚本移到本地脚本中，既可修改本地脚本内容，也可修改 cron 表达式，方便用户在本地脚本中，进入脚本文件修改脚本代码，或者修改 cron 脚本的执行时间

## 1. Create a single local branch and copy js

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Open Loon and click the `Configuration` column below, and click `Subscribe script`

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Click the subscription script where the script is located, **here is the sample subscription of the previous tutorial subscription as an example**

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Click the script that the user needs to create a single local branch, **Here is the script of Jingdong East and Yisign as an example**

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) If you don’t need to modify the `alias` or `cron expression`, you don’t need to change any settings at this time, just click ` Save` to complete the operation, the script in the subscription script will be automatically disabled
