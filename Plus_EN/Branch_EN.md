# Create a single local branch

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Move the scripts needed in the subscription script to the local script, but the content of the local script cannot be modified, only the cron expression can be modified, which is convenient for users to modify the execution time of the cron script in the local script
