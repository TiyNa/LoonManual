# The bottom line clause of the rule-`Final rule`

## Understanding of `FINAL, Final`

`FIANL` is a necessary format requirement in Loon configuration, while `Fianl` is actually a strategy, and `Final` can be replaced with

- `DIRECT`

- ~~REJECT~~ (It is indeed possible to write this, but it is tossing users, so it is not recommended)

- `Agent Strategy Group`

- `Mother Strategy Group`

## Understanding of the three situations of replacement

- `DIRECT`

  - That is, if the local rules and subscription rules are not matched, the direct connection strategy is used for the network request initiated by the user
  
  - For example: `FINAL,DIRECT` <===> directly select direct access
  
- `Agent Strategy Group`

  - That is, if the local rules and subscription rules are not matched, use the `proxy node` for the network request initiated by the user
  
  - For example: `FINAL, manual selection` <===> Manual selection >>> Proxy node (here, `manual selection` is just an example name, in fact, the proxy policy group name and node are set according to the user's needs)
  
- `Mother Strategy Group`

  - That is, if the local rules and subscription rules do not match, the network request initiated by the user requires the user to choose
  
  - For example: `FINAL,Final` <===> Final >>> DIRECT / Proxy (here `Fianl` is just an example name of the strategy group, in fact the name of the strategy group is set according to the user's needs)
  
## Deep understanding of the third situation

When the configuration says `FINAL,Final`, the following types of `parent policy groups` can be made through the nesting between the `child-parent policy groups`

As shown in the figure above, the user needs to manually preset the strategy to go when a fish slipping through the net appears. If the user chooses

- `DIRECT` built-in strategy group, namely directly select direct access

- `Proxy` parent policy group, the nesting situation is: Proxy >>> manually select >>> proxy node, that is, use proxy node to access
