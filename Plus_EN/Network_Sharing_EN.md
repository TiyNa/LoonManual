# network sharing

Q: I have two devices. I downloaded Loon on one of them. Can the other device realize the scientific Internet access without downloading loon?

A: It can be achieved through the `Network Sharing` function.

## The role of network sharing

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Loon provides an HTTP/SOCKET5 proxy server to other devices under Wi-Fi, so that those under the same Wi-Fi Other devices, through the user manually set the HTTP proxy port and server in other devices to achieve scientific Internet access

## Necessary conditions for enabling this feature

- A device (the device that has downloaded Loon)

  - Personal hotspot must be turned off in the settings

  - The wireless LAN/Wi-Fi function must be turned on and connected to a Wi-Fi
  
  - The `Network Sharing` function must be turned on in Loon
  
- B device (the device that did not download Loon)

  - The wireless LAN/Wi-Fi function must be turned on and connected to the same Wi-Fi as the A device
  
  - Manually set the HTTP proxy configuration
  
## 1. Add the shortcut of `Network Sharing` to Loon's `Instrument` bar interface

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Open the Loon interface and click on the designated area on the right of `Shortcut`

# Say a few more words

- Device A turns on the hotspot to device B, and then uses network sharing on device A to connect to device B scientifically. This will not work!

  - [Questions from enthusiastic netizens](https://t.me/Loon0x00/481366)

- MacBook users are asked to find out the tutorial for setting up the proxy for the notebook by themselves. This tutorial will not go into details

- The reason that the user is required to perform the first step is that there is no `Network Sharing` UI in the `Configuration` column of Loon. Currently, the `Network Sharing` function can only be enabled in the following two ways

  - `Network Sharing` card
  
  - Write relevant code in `text configuration` (this method is obsolete)

- For device A, after turning on the `Network Sharing` function, there will be a `⛔️` emoticon pack under the `Network Sharing` card, please turn on the wireless LAN / Wi-Fi function and connect to a Wi-Fi

- For device B, you cannot use this function to achieve scientific Internet access on some APPs. It may be that this type of APP uses `SOCKET5 proxy`. Please manually configure the SOCKET5 proxy server and port in the settings of this type of APP.
