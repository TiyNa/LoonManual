## Correct nesting demonstration

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) This tutorial only allows users to nest between policy groups and policy groups, if you want Loon to use nodes in the sub-policy group , The parent policy group and the child policy group need to be nested correctly.
