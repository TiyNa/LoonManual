# Add plugin URL

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) This tutorial allows users to learn about the format requirements and content requirements of the URL filled in in the `add plugin`

## 1. Requirements for URL format and content

- Requirements for URL format

  - For files uploaded to the github library, the subscription address URL must start with `http://raw`
  
- Requirements for URL content

  - Must have a Loon configuration file format, currently supports `[Rule]`, `[URL Rewrite]`, `[Script]`, `[MITM]` modules for the time being, and more modules will be expanded later
  
## 2. URL content demonstration

```
[Rule]
DOMAIN,google.com,PROXY

[URL Rewrite]
^https?:\/\/(www.)?(g|google)\.cn https://www.google.com 302

[Script]
http-request ^https?:\/\/(www.)?(example)\.com script-path=localscript.js,tag = requestScript,enable=true
http-response ^https?:\/\/(www.)?(example)\.com script-path=https://example.com/loon.js,timeout=10,requires-body = true,tag = responseScript,enable=true
cron "0 8 * * *" script-path=cron.js,tag = responseScript,enable=true

[MITM]
hostname = *.example.com,*.sample.com
```

# Say a few more words

- Although the `[Script]` module is supported, it is not recommended to write the script configuration code of the **check-in script** into the plug-in file, because adding scripts in this way does not allow users to modify the script execution time

- It is recommended to write script configuration code similar to `Jingdong, Taobao historical price script` into the plug-in file, because such scripts will not have pop-up reminders, and there is no need to modify the execution time
