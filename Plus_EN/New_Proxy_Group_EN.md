# Manually add a policy group

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Please note that this tutorial adds a child policy group, and will never be a parent policy group. The child policy group able to pass

- The selection of `policy` in `subscription rules` becomes `parent policy group`

- Become a `secondary policy group` by `add` in `strategy group` / actively add a `second child policy group` to become a `substrategy group`

- Actively add `subscribe node` or `filter subscription node` to become an agent strategy group

## Enter `Strategy Group` to add a strategy group
