### Configuration column

The purpose is to improve the user's ability to customize the Loon configuration, and write tutorials in the order of the `configuration` column panel

#### Node

- [Single node](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Proxy.md) (add proxy node manually)

- [Subscription Node](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Remote_Proxy.md) (subscribe to a collection of nodes, usually provided by the airport the user purchased)

- Screening subscription nodes (screening subscription nodes into proxy nodes that users need, reducing too many proxy nodes to appear in the policy group, and making it easy for users to choose the proxy nodes they need)

  - [Regular expression](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Regex.md) (Master the basic regular expression writing)

  - [Filter method with filter type `NodeSelect`](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Remote_Filter_NodeSelect.md) (manually filter nodes)
  
  - [Filtering method with the filter type `NameKeyword`](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Remote_Filter_NameKeyword.md) (Use keywords to filter subscription nodes, but nodes cannot be excluded)

  - [Filter method with filter type `NameRegex`](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Remote_Filter.md) (Use regular expression to filter subscription nodes)

- Use Sub-Store to filter subscription nodes (simple, efficient and convenient)

  - [Text Tutorial](https://www.notion.so/Sub-Store-6259586994d34c11a4ced5c406264b46)

- [Nesting between node and policy group](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Remote_Proxy_in_Proxy_Group.md) (add proxy node under the policy group)

#### Strategy

- Loon without default proxy policy group

  - [Proxy Policy Group](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Default_Proxy.md) (Understand the proxy policy group, with [understanding of global policy](https:// github.com/chiupam/tutorial/blob/master/Loon/Plus/Global_Group.md) tutorial)

  - [Understanding of the global strategy](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/Global_Group.md) (the reason why the global agent must be used with the global strategy)
  
- [New Policy Group](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/New_Proxy_Group.md) (manually add a sub-policy group)

- Parent strategy group and child strategy group

  - [Correctly distinguish between parent policy group and child policy group](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/TOP_Policy.md)

  - [Set PCC policy group](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/PCC.md) (the same host name locks the same node)
  
- Set SSID policy group

  - [Method 1: Setting of built-in ssid strategy group](https://github.com/TiyNa/LoonManual/blob/main/Plus/ssid.md) (This tutorial needs to understand more concepts and is relatively simple, Not flexible enough)
